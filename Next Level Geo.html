<p>While higher interest rates in late 2022 and 2023 have slowed the pace of home price acceleration in the Palm Beach County area, it is clear that affordability is  still a challenge, as interest rates are much higher today against the <b>backdrop of the most elevated home prices on record</b>. Indicators such as price reductions can be a sign of improvement, however these reductions vary by price tier. The reductions seen in 2023 thus far, and actively on the market, point to reductions in areas where home prices are the highest.</p>

<p>The below map indicates that there are signification home price reductions by homesellers, albeit off extremely high home prices, to encourage homebuyers to continue buying at higher interest rates today. While visual evidence in the map suggests that the <i>highest home prices by absolute value</i> are exposed to the greatest reductions, <b>the price/square foot</b>, indicated by the darkest blue coloring, also appears to be another indicator for price reductions.</p>

<p>Like many counties nationally, the Palm Beach County Housing Market has changed greatly over the past few years due to COVID-19. A suppressed supply of for sale inventory, coupled with sustained demand, has pushed home prices through the roof and put a strain on affordability in the area.</p>
